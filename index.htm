					<h2>About Us</h2>
					<p><img src="images/arm_under_hood.jpg" class="img-left-align-100" alt="Arm under the hood of a car."></p>
					<p>In 1999, Carl &#40;our founder&#41; started his first job as an automotive technician. For the next 8 years, he worked for different repair shops, noticing a trend between them:<br>
						<em>A lack of <b>integrity</b></em>.</p>
					<p>Seeing customers become frustrated with not knowing why repairs and services were being recommended, he ventured on a new endeavor, making the other&#8217;s greatest weakness his greatest <em>strength</em>. Customers were skeptical at first, but Carl&#8217;s&nbsp;Auto&nbsp;Repair quickly gained the trust of many. 12 years later, there are over 30 people dedicated to making sure you are treated the right way.</p>
