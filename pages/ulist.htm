					<h2>What Is That&#63;</h2>
					<p><img src="../images/mil_illuminated.jpg" class="img-left-align-100" alt="MIL illuminated in gauges"></p>
					<p>At some point and time you have probably seen the image above. Usually referred to as the <em>Check Engine Light</em>, its technical name is the <em>Malfunction Indicator Light</em>, or MIL.</p>
					<p>Different people will deal with it in different ways. If no noticeable running issue is felt, some might ignore it, or if they don&#8217;t want to look at it, put a piece of tape over it. Others will wait until the next service to investigate, or schedule an appointment immediately.</p>
					<p>Depending where you live in the state of Pennsylvania, you will have to repair the problem to pass the annual emissions test. Having the MIL illuminated during testing will fail in any county where the On-Board Diagnostic 2&#40;OBD-II&#41; test is administered. There are 42 counties in the state that have a visual inspection performed with the annual safety inspection instead of an OBD-II test. Having the MIL illuminated is irrelevant for this type of inspection. It also does not matter in an OBD-II inspection county if the vehicle was driven less than 5,000 miles in the previous 12 months, as an exemption sticker will be issued.</p>
					<p>If you don&#8217;t want to pay for diagnostic, you can stop at an auto parts store where they will read the diagnostic trouble code for free. Just beware that they might not have a solution, or the <em>correct</em> one &#40;you get what you pay for&#41;. It should be investigated and resolved to keep your vehicle in top shape.</p>

					<h2>When Is the MIL On&#63;</h2>
					<p><img src="../images/ecm_connectors.jpg" class="img-left-align-100" alt="ECM Connectors"></p>
					<p>There are different reasons why the MIL &#40;Malfunction Indicator Light&#41; illuminates, but the root cause is that a Diagnostic Trouble Code &#40;DTC&#41; has set in the Engine Control Module &#40;ECM, sometimes called Powertrain Control Module, or PCM&#41;. A DTC is set when a control module detects an error.
					</p>
					<p>There are three different classes of errors. The first class is a 2&#45;trip error. If a problem is detected, it will store a temporary DTC but will not illuminate the MIL. If the same error occurs a second time, a permanent DTC will be stored and the MIL will illuminate.</p>
					<p>The second is a 1&#45;trip error. Just like it sounds, the first time the error occurs the MIL will illuminate.</p>
					<p>The third is an error indicating <em>damage to the catalytic converter</em> could occur. Instead of the MIL just illuminating, it will flash. It is best to pull over and turn the vehicle off. Catalytic converters are <strong>expensive</strong>, and you probably don&#8217;t want to pay for one if you don&#8217;t have to.</p>
					<p>Most control modules communicate with each other in vehicles today. If one sets a DTC, they all might. It is a redundency. If one module dies, you can still get information as to what is wrong.</p>
