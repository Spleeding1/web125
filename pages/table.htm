				<h2>What We Offer</h2>
				<p><img src="../images/fluid_bottles.jpg" class="img-left-align-100" alt="Vehicle fluid bottles"></p>
				<p>You probably see ads for oil changes and other services at different locations, all emphasizing their <em>low&nbsp;prices</em>. You might think you are getting a deal, but there are reasons why their price is that low. It might be an attempt to get you to their location so they can upsell other, overpriced services, or they might be using cheaper products that won&#8217;t hold up over time.</p>
				<p>We aren&#8217;t going to pretend to have the lowest prices, because we don&#8217;t. What we do have is the  <strong>best&nbsp;value</strong>. Our products are top notch, and the service we provide is superb. When you bring your vehicle to us, you can be confident that we aren&#8217;t just trying to make an extra dollar. We want to see your vehicle last as long as possible. We pride ourselves on integrity, which means everybody wins.</p>

				<h2>Oil Viscosity Matters</h2>
				<p><img src="../images/sae_oil_label.jpg" class="img-left-align-100" alt="Oil viscosity label"></p>
				<p>If you&#8217;ve ever walked into an auto parts store to the engine oil isle, you&#8217;ve probably seen a vast assortment of types of engine oil. You might wonder which one is best for your car, and does it really matter.</p>
				<p>Well, it does. There are many parts in the engine that have only a few thousandths-of-an-inch clearance between them. There are also tiny passageways that oil flows through to activate and deactivate variable-valve timing. Using an oil that is too low of a viscosity means that the thin barrier of oil may not be strong enough to keep the metal pieces from rubbing together. To high, and the oil might not be thin enough to get into the tight places it needs to. Either way, this can cause running problems and or engine failure.</p>
					<p><strong>Always be sure to check your owner&#8217;s manual for the correct specifications for your vehicle.</strong></p>
